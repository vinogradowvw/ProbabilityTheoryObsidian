Variance is an [[Expected value|expected value]] of the squared deviation of [[Expected value|expected value]] of the random variable. The variance expresses how far the values of random variable are spread from the [[Expected value|expected value]], this is a measure of dispersion.
$$D[X] = E[(X-E[X])^2] = E[X^2] - E[X]^2$$
### Properties of variance
1. $D[cX] = c^2D[X]$
2. $D[X_{1} + X_{2}] \neq D[X_{1}] - D[X_{2}]$
