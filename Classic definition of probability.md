The probability of an event is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes in the experiment.
# Outcome
Those outcomes ${\omega_{1}, \omega_{2}, \omega_{3} \dots }$ must satisfy the following conditions:
1)  Those outcomes are actually all possible outcomes that can occur in the experiment (**collectively exhaustive**).
2) Those outcomes are **mutually exclusive** (or pairwise incompatible).
3) All outcomes are equally possible .

Than $\Omega = {\omega_{1}, \omega_{2}, \omega_{3}\dots, \omega_{n}}$ is the **sample space**
and the **probability** of **outcome** equals:

$$
P(\omega_{i}) := \frac{1}{n}
$$
# Event
The **event** is the **subset** of **sample space**: $A \subset \Omega$

Probability of **event** equals:
$$
P(A):=\frac{|A|}{n}
$$
# Properties of probability
1) $P(A) \in [0, 1]$
2) $P(A) = 1 \Leftrightarrow A = \Omega$
3) $P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A)$
4) $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
