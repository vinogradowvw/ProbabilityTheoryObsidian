Generally, Moivre-Laplace theorem states that the [[Binomial Distribution]] can be approximated under certain conditions.

More specifically, this theorem states that probability of:
$P\left( a \leq \frac{{\mu_{n} - np}}{\sqrt{ npq }} \leq b \right)$ with $n \to \infty$ 
tends to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2\pi }}\int_{a}^b e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}} dx$
